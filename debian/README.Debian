# What about libodbc.so? (bug #171370)
#

According to the upstream authors the library can safely be installed
as libodbc.so to use it with OpenOffice, R and other applications.

It is not yet done in Debian by default as currently unixODBC maintains
a symlink to libodbc.so and using alternatives for shared libraries is
maybe dangerous. We are currently deciding if maybe one ODBC library
can be dropped alltogether.
